# Conclusion

Now that you have experimented with several providers and services you should have a pretty good idea of what you are getting into when people talk about cloud.  You should be able to refer back to a services documentation to see suggested usage and trace (or build) your way through fog to a working solution.  You should be able to have tools and systems built on top of these solutions that can be evaluated on different platforms and migrated if the need arises. And most importantly of all you should feel empowered by the resources that are now, quite literally, at your fingertips.

## Next!

We will leave some time for questions and discussion, but first I want to leave you with some suggestions on how to continue your learning.

### Extra Credit

Now that you have an understanding about how these peices fit together there are a number of things you could do, here are a few suggestions for further learning:

* Try out more of the services, find out what works best for you
* Contribute to your favorite services or add one that was left out
* Report issues and submit pull requests
* Spread the love by sharing your cloud experiences with friends and peers. Blog posts and talks (lightning or otherwise) are great ways to share you experiences and educate others.
