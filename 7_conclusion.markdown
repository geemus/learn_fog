# Conclusion

Now that you have experimented with several providers and services you should have a good foundation for working with cloud services. You should be able to refer back to a services documentation to see suggested usage and work your way through fog to a solution.  You can then build tools and systems on top to evaluate different platforms and migrate if the need arises. Most importantly you should feel empowered by the resources that are now, quite literally, at your fingertips.

## Next!

We will leave some time for questions and discussion, but first I want to leave you with some suggestions on how to continue your learning.

### Extra Credit

Now that you have an understanding about how these peices fit together there are a number of things you could do, here are a few suggestions for further learning:

* Try out more of the services, find out what works best for you
* Contribute to your favorite services or add one that was left out
* Report issues and submit pull requests
* Spread the love by sharing your cloud experiences with friends and peers. Blog posts and talks (lightning or otherwise) are great ways to share you experiences and educate others.
