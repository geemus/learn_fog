h1. Documentation

Your first task will be to practice storing data, but first we will explore how to find information on tasks in documentation.

h2. Amazon Simple Storage Solution (S3)

We will be using S3 to store a file, I usually fall back to the internet to find collected [Amazon S3 documentation](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3). But rather than messing with that there should also be a copy of the relevant documents in your unzipped resources at `learn_fog/documentation/s3/developer_guide` and `learn_fog/documentation/s3/api_documentation`.

h3. Developer Guide

The developer guides for amazon services provide a good overview of how to do various tasks without having to dig into the nitty gritty right away.

h3. API Documentation

Now, with that overview in hand we can go over to the api documentation to see the specifics.

  TODO

h2. Back in the fog

Though you won't often need to use it, fog has a pretty direct mapping to these api methods that we will refer to as `requests`. In `1_storage_requests.html` we will explore these and finally start storing our important data!
