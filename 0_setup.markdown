h1. Setup

First thing is first, you will want to get a local copy of the resources (learn_fog.zip) for the tutorial. You can fetch these files from any of these locations that might be available to you:

# Local Network
# URL
# CD
# USB Drive

h2. Learn fog Resources

The unzipped file should contain the following, which you'll need for the other lessons:

1.
2.
3.
4.

h2. The Docs

All of the instructions should go in order top to bottom and provide everything you need to work through them, followed by some extra credit you can do if time allows. Examples contain two special characters to keep an eye out for.  '!' represents something you should try yourself to see what happens and '?' represents something you'll need to figure out how to fill in (feel free to leave it out sometimes to see what happens then as well).

h3. Installing fog

Now that you have unzipped the file you can install fog from the unzipped directory:

    gem install learn_fog/fog.gem

h4. Next!

Continue with the tutorial in `1_documentation.html`.
