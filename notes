red dirt presentation
  init - what is fog, what will we cover, agenda, etc
  setup - unpack files, checkout out contents, install the gem
  documentation - 
  requests - start with mocked requests: s3 then rackspace (show api docs and give an overview of how to navigate them)
  models - move into mocked models and discuss what is and is not shared in the api. adapt previous examples to accommodate
  local - use models to drive both sets of mocks but then transition to real local; explore how it is models only and why

slides should accompany with really explicit steps (but not too much detail)

virtualbox! for setup (ie have an image that has everything pre-installed) see engine45.com
go in to more depth on how to fill in the first ? in storage_requests
emphasize power of generic models
make sure models example makes explicit the relation to requests
for local storage example actually create a file (maybe html) then explicitly browse
