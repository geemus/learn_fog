red dirt presentation
  introduction - what is fog, what will we cover, agenda, etc
  documentation - details how to teach yourself about docs
  requests - start with mocked requests: s3 then rackspace (show api docs and give an overview of how to navigate them)
    go in to more depth on how to fill in the first ? in storage_requests
  models - move into mocked models and discuss what is and is not shared in the api. adapt previous examples to accommodate
    emphasize power of generic models
    make sure models example makes explicit the relation to requests
  local - use models to drive both sets of mocks but then transition to real local; explore how it is models only and why
    for local storage example actually create a file (maybe html) then explicitly browse

virtualbox! for setup (ie have an image that has everything pre-installed) see engine45.com

slides should accompany with really explicit steps (but not too much detail)
